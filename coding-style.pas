(*
	This is a reference document for my personal use. I want to have a 
	consistent coding style in Pascal, that is why I would like to have
	something like a reference cheat sheet to look at when in doubt.

	1. Start each program, however small it may be, with the following line:
		{$mode objfpc}{$H+}{$J-}
	   I read this in a book on modern Pascal. This has to do with strings.
	   I don't really work with that now, but I thought it would be a nice 
	   habit to have.

	2. Always name your programs UsingCamelCase_AndUnderscores; 
	   Start the name with a Capital letter.

	3. Declare CONSTS using capital letters.

	4. Declare variables using camelCase, start the name with a regular letter.

	5. Indent using tabs, 1 tab = 4 spaces. 

	6. Indent any logical piece of code, kinda following the Pythonic way of
	   writing code.
